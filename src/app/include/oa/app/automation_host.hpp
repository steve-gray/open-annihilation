// The table through which the automation endpoint (src/app/automation)
// reads what the running game holds beyond what the check host
// (check_host.hpp) reads: the preferences as the game holds them now, the
// file they live in, the running match's Game block, world and digest, the
// controls of the screen shown and the frames the game presents in its
// window; and through which it holds keys and pointer buttons down for the
// game's reads of what is held (the input it hands the game goes through
// SDL's event queue, as a device's does). The other entries only read, or
// have the game copy what it presents; none changes what the game shows,
// plays or simulates. The endpoint gets the table with
// automation_host() from a hook that is given the runtime, and may keep it
// while the runtime lives, on the thread that runs main(). What an entry
// returns stays valid until the runtime next runs a frame, a pass of its
// screens or a hook of the endpoint's, unless the entry says otherwise.
//
// The header names only the standard library's types and declares the
// engine's it names, so the endpoint needs nothing more of the engine's to
// read it.
