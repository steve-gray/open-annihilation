// oa-game's extension table: the hooks through which libraries linked into
// oa-game add launch options and switches, screens, per-frame work, match
// events and checks. Each such library is an extension: the project that
// builds the game registers it (oa_add_extension, cmake/OaExtensions.cmake)
// with its init function, void <init>(oa::app::Extension* table), which
// fills a zeroed table of its own. main() calls every registered init once,
// before the command line is parsed, and combines the tables into the one
// the engine calls (ExtensionList, extension_list.hpp). A library that
// includes runtime.hpp builds against oa::extension-sdk. Network play is
// one of them: the engine registers it in every build (oa-app-netgame,
// src/app/netgame), and other extensions build on it or beside it. Every
// hook no extension fills keeps the engine's own behaviour.
//
// The extensions are listed in dependency order: one whose library links
// another registered extension comes after it, and the rest keep the order
// they were registered in. An extension later in the list builds on those
// before it. When several extensions fill a hook, the combined table calls
// them by these rules:
// - every extension, in list order: check_options, startup,
//   register_screens, ready, check_multiplayer_menu, frame, match_game,
//   match_event, check_console, draw_loading, draw_match_hud,
//   draw_match_overlay, pause_changed, load_progress, speed_changed and
//   app_mode_set; also message_hooks, console_host and team_panel_host,
//   whose entries are single owners (below);
// - every extension, in reverse list order: shutdown and release_runtime;
// - the first that takes it, asking the last extension in the list first:
//   take_option (the option goes to the first that takes it, with that
//   extension's effects), the switch handlers (a letter goes to the first
//   handler that takes it; every handler's reset runs), run_mode (for each
//   phase), start_scene, simulation_step, give_resources, player_gone,
//   close_requested, open_recording (each extension asked is given replay
//   and info all zero, and only the one that takes the recording fills the
//   caller's) and select_multiplayer (the first answer other than
//   unavailable);
// - the first answer, asking the last extension in the list first: the
//   first that is not null for disconnect_text and for text's usage_note
//   and register_switch (an empty text is an answer), and the first that
//   is neither null nor empty for return_label and for each field of
//   frontend_entry;
// - joined in list order: text's usage_checks, usage_runs and
//   usage_switches;
// - every extension asked, the answers combined: state (their bits OR'd),
//   keep_stored_password (true when any answers true) and outcome_ready
//   (true when every one answers true);
// - at most one extension: frontend_game and frontend_states. A second
//   extension that fills either stops the start, before the command line is
//   parsed, with a message that names both. Each entry of the hosts that
//   message_hooks, console_host and team_panel_host fill is likewise one
//   extension's: an extension that changes an entry another extension has
//   set, in that call or an earlier one, stops the call with an error
//   that names both, which is the hook's error (below).
// With one extension the combined table behaves as that extension's own.
//
// A check an extension runs from run_mode or check_multiplayer_menu drives
// the running game through the check host (check_host.hpp), which is not
// part of this table.
//
// The engine calls every hook on the thread that runs main(), and passes
// Extension::context back unchanged; the extension owns it and keeps it
// valid until the process exits. Pointers and references a hook receives
// are valid for that call only unless its documentation says otherwise.
//
// Hooks report bad input by throwing std::runtime_error, as the engine code
// around them does. The engine calls every hook, and every entry of the
// switch handler and the replay a hook returns, through one guarded call
// (call_hook, hook_call.hpp), which catches what the hook throws, whatever
// its type, before it reaches engine code. What follows is one of three
// handlings, and each hook says which is its own:
// - raised: the engine raises the hook's message as its own error at the
//   call, before it uses anything the hook answered, and the error takes
//   the path the engine's own errors take from that call. Mostly that ends
//   the game: main() prints "open-annihilation: <message>" and exits with
//   status 1. One kind of path catches it, a match start the frontend falls
//   back from: a campaign mission's start, wherever it comes from, a
//   skirmish started from its setup's Start, a saved game loaded from the
//   load dialog, and the in-game restart. The start is abandoned where it
//   stopped and the frontend runs on; the status line shows "campaign
//   start: <message>", "Skirmish start failed: <message>", "Saved game
//   start: <message>" or "Restart failed: <message>", which stderr also
//   receives. A failed skirmish start leaves no match and returns to the
//   skirmish setup, which shows the message in a message box, or the
//   warning that the mod's files are missing when they are; a failed
//   restart returns to the main menu. Other starts (a skirmish a headless
//   run starts, a saved skirmish a --load run loads) are not caught.
//   frontend_game, state, match_game, console_host, team_panel_host and
//   return_label are reached there;
// - reported: the engine reports the message and carries on as the hook
//   says, mostly as it does for that call when the hook is null:
//   simulation_step, player_gone, message_hooks, match_event, draw_loading,
//   draw_match_hud, draw_match_overlay, pause_changed and load_progress.
//   Unless the hook says otherwise the report is one line on standard
//   error (the game's log when it plays), "open-annihilation: extension
//   hook <hook>: <message>"; the same line again is printed only when its
//   count reaches a power of two, with the count;
// - must not throw: speed_changed, app_mode_set, release_runtime and the
//   hooks of ReplayHooks. One that throws all the same is reported as a reported
//   hook is, and the engine carries on as it does when the hook is null.
// Every other hook's error is raised. When several extensions fill a hook,
// those after the one that threw are not called for that call.
// docs/development/conventions.md states this rule for the extension table
// beside the rules of each layer.

/// The version of the extension table's contract an extension is built
/// against. An extension checks oa::app::extension_api_version, its typed
/// copy below, with static_assert; the macro serves an extension that builds
/// against more than one engine and tests the version with #if.
///
/// Raise it by one in the change that alters the contract: a hook added,
/// removed or renamed; a hook's parameters, return value or the meaning of
/// leaving it null; when or in which order the engine calls it; what it may
/// keep or must free; its error behaviour; a type, enumerator or bit the
/// table uses; or a function an extension calls to read a value the engine
/// resolved. A change to wording alone keeps it. Version 2 is the first
/// with the layered layout's names: this header is oa/app/extension.hpp and
/// the types the table names are in their modules' namespaces. Version 3
/// replaces offers_multiplayer with select_multiplayer, which MULTI calls
/// and through which the extension may take the game over. Version 4 gives
/// ConsoleHost::post_message the line's sender, calls console_host as each
/// match starts, so that the console's host is filled before the match's
/// first tick, and adds draw_match_overlay, which draws over the
/// battlefield. Version 5 adds pause_changed, load_progress and
/// team_panel_host; no simulation step is offered while the running match's
/// pause bit is set, whoever set it; a shared match's clock keeps running
/// while its in-game menu, or the preferences that menu opens, are up
/// (Runtime::match_running) and while outcome_ready holds it on its
/// outcome. Version 6 adds close_requested and the hook that named the
/// match's return, FrontendEntry::nickname, TeamPanelHost::tournament_game,
/// the ScreenServices entries quit, stop_sounds, play_sound_alternate and
/// run_frontend, and query_register; the hook that told whether the stored
/// password is kept is also asked as each match starts, and a
/// ScreenContext's host and services may be kept while the runtime lives.
/// Version 7 adds speed_changed, which the speed keys and the GAME slider
/// call, and app_mode_set, which every application mode the frontend sets
/// calls. Version 8 lets several extensions fill tables of their own, each
/// through the init function its registration names in place of the one
/// global init, and combines their hooks by the rules above; replaces those
/// two version 6 hooks with return_label, whose label alone now decides
/// what the match's menus show, and keep_stored_password, which only the
/// preferences write asks; and refuses a reserved game switch no extension
/// takes with "-<switch> is not handled by this build". Version 9 adds
/// open_recording, which hands an extension a recording's bytes to replay
/// into a match the engine steps one tick at a time, with the types
/// RecordingInput, RecordingInfo, RecordingStatus and ReplayHooks. Version
/// 10 calls every hook through a guarded call that catches what it throws:
/// the errors of simulation_step, player_gone, message_hooks, match_event,
/// draw_loading, draw_match_hud, draw_match_overlay, pause_changed and
/// load_progress are reported and the engine carries on as for a null hook;
/// the rest are raised as the engine's own errors at the call; a switch
/// handler entry that throws stops the start with its message; and the
/// hooks that must not throw, now the ReplayHooks' too, are reported when
/// they do. Version 11 adds release_runtime, through which an extension
/// frees what it keeps for a runtime as that runtime is destroyed. Version
/// 12 adds option_effect::remote_controlled, the effect of an option that
/// lets a program on this machine control the run through the extension:
/// the engine then keeps the main loop running every frame while the window
/// is inactive, and Options::remote_controlled says so. Version 13 adds
/// FrameStage::presented: the frame hook is called a third time each frame,
/// after the frame is drawn and shown. Version 14 adds functions an
/// extension calls. None is a hook: the engine does not call them, and no
/// extension fills them. player_folder(const Runtime&) reads the player's
/// own folder for the run. set_unit_limit(Runtime&, int32_t) sets the unit
/// limit preference, the configured limit a multiplayer game uses.
/// keep_running_while_inactive(Runtime&, bool) holds or releases a request
/// that the main loop keep running every frame while the window is inactive:
/// held, the frame hook keeps being called there; released, the loop waits
/// for an event, as it does otherwise. web_address_available() and
/// open_web_address(const char*) ask whether this machine can open a web
/// address in the system's browser and open an http or https address there;
/// on a Steam Deck in Game Mode the answer is no. modern_text_chain,
/// modern_text_layout, modern_text_pixels, message_log_text_size,
/// game_text_preferences_of, game_text_preferences and
/// set_focused_text_field read the modern text faces and their fallback
/// chain at a pixel size, lay a line out and draw it, take the message log's
/// face at the player's Text size, read the player's "Use modern fonts for
/// game text" and "Text size" settings, and tell the engine where the
/// focused text field is, for the input method's candidate window and the
/// on-screen keyboard. read_game_file reads one whole file from the game's
/// files: a loose file wins over a file of the same path in an archive, a
/// mod's archive among them, and a missing file returns false without
/// throwing. set_extension_window_source shows the extension's windows and
/// controls to a program on this machine that drives the game, and the
/// engine calls that source when the program asks for the screen's controls.
/// extension_clock is the clock the extension's idle work follows: in a run
/// that program controls it advances by the fixed clock's step once a frame
/// and does not read the wall clock, and while the fixed clock is on it is
/// that clock. simulation_hash reads the simulation hash the run plays
/// under: the profile in play, with every Developer Mode override that
/// changes the simulation, or the plain baseline when the game plays 3.1c. A
/// running match keeps the hash it started with.
