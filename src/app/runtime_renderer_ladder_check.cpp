// --check-renderer-ladder: each renderer failure the game handles while it
// runs, forced on the renderer the start made, and the game presenting on
// through it. On the dummy video driver every hardware driver refuses, so
// the walk ends on SDL's software renderer, and every rebuild makes that
// renderer again. Then the renderer records across simulated restarts of
// the game, each reading the files a start in a scratch folder finds, as
// the player's own profile keeps them: strikes and records of crashes and
// of failures while running, the walk that skips a recorded driver and
// walks again when that leaves nothing able to present, the adapter as
// another driver words it, a trial that cannot be written, the 2 GiB rule,
// the main menu's notice and the settings dialog's retry; and the Full
// tier's own fallbacks, switched on as --hardware-acceleration=full and
// --force-capable would: a card call that fails, which drops Full to Basic
// with a strike, the same in the next run recorded full-unusable and told
// once, and a raise of the row clearing it; Full's left-over trial, struck
// once and recorded twice, or once where the first counts; its trial that
// cannot be written; and a shared game, in which a lower tier applies at
// once, a higher one from the next game, and every page is made as the
// loading screen begins. Four cases run only when --render-fault names
// them, since they switch the accelerated tier on where every other case
// draws in the standard tier: slow frames, which walk the step-down down
// its ladder to the standard tier, and the memory guard, which refuses the
// tier's buffers and then drops it; and the same for Full, whose rungs the
// step-down takes first and whose pages the guard drops first.
