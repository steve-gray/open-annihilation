// What the player is shown and asked while a mod package installs: each
// prompt's title, text and buttons, and what each button answers. Every
// text is an English template looked up in the interface catalogue
// (oa/data/languages/interface_text.hpp) and then filled with its values,
// which are never looked up: mod names, versions, file names, paths and
// sizes. The captions shared with the settings' own dialogs are the same
// English words, so one catalogue entry serves both.
