// Mod packages (.oamod): a zip archive of a mod's folder, installed into the
// player's own Mods folder under the id its oamod.yaml gives. A package is
// read and checked before anything is written (open_package); what the
// Mods folder holds decides where it goes and what the player is asked
// (plan_install); its files are unpacked into a staging folder inside Mods,
// a piece at a time (Unpacking), then put in place by renames on the same
// volume (commit_change), which keep the version an update replaced in the
// mod's .backup folder, one version back. A crash at any point leaves
// folders that the next start settles to the state before the change or
// after it (recover_changes), and the folders a change drops are deleted a
// little at a time (Discarder). No function here throws: errors are values.
