// Packages: a zip archive of one kind of package, installed into that kind's
// folder of the player's own folder under the id its manifest gives. A
// package is read and checked before anything is written (open_package);
// what the kind's root folder holds decides where it goes and what the
// player is asked (the kind's plan); its files are unpacked into a staging
// folder inside that root, a piece at a time (Unpacking), then put in place
// by renames on the same volume (commit_change), which keep the version an
// update replaced in the package's .backup folder, one version back. A crash
// at any point leaves folders that the next start settles to the state
// before the change or after it (recover_changes), and the folders a change
// drops are deleted a little at a time (Discarder). One table of kinds says
// what differs: today the oamod kind, whose manifest is oamod.yaml and whose
// root folder is Mods. No function here throws: errors are values.
