# Packages

This module installs packages into a folder of the player's own folder. One
table of kinds says what differs; it holds the mod kind, `oamod`, the
map pack kind, `oamap`, and the language pack kind, `oalang`. A mod package
is a zip archive of a mod's folder, the one that holds its `oamod.yaml`; it
installs into `Mods/<id>`, by the id its profile gives, whatever the file is
called. A map pack installs into `Maps/<id>`. A language pack installs into
`Languages/<tag>`, by the tag its `language.yaml` gives. The module has no
SDL: the game's runtime shows what it asks
and answers (`src/app/runtime_mod_install.cpp`,
"Mod packages" in [src/app](../README.md#mod-packages-oamod) and
"Map packs" in [src/app](../README.md#map-packs-oamap)).

## Entry points

`oa/app/package_install.hpp`, namespace `oa::app::package_install`:

- `open_package` reads a package and checks it before anything is written:
  its directory through the streamed zip reader
  (`oa/formats/zip/stream.hpp`), where its `oamod.yaml` lies, every name it
  unpacks, its sizes, and its profile, resolved twice as a load of the mod
  resolves it (the second time with its packaged INI file, or the game
  folder's, and the registry values).
- `plan_install`, the oamod kind's plan, decides, from what each folder of
  Mods holds (`FolderHooks`), where a package goes and what it asks.
- `Unpacking` unpacks a package's files into a staging folder inside Mods,
  a budget of bytes a step. It first hashes the package file, a piece at a
  time, each byte of the budget, and the prompt reads `Checking {file}...`.
  Then its folders, its files, the origin record, and a sync of each folder
  and, on macOS, one flush of the drive's cache to storage. Each folder or
  file made and each folder synced costs `unpack_entry_cost` (16 KiB) of
  the budget, and a step ends after about 4 ms, so that a package of many
  small files never holds a frame long.
- `commit_change` puts a change in place with renames on one volume.
- `recover_changes` settles what a stop left, and `Discarder` deletes the
  folders a change drops a little at a time.
- `read_installed_mod` and `read_backup`, the oamod kind's, read what a
  folder and its `.backup` hold, for the plan and the Mods page's ROLL BACK.

`oa/app/package_install/inbox.hpp` keeps what outlives each run of the game in
one process: the packages waiting for the main menu (`post_package_file`,
`take_package_file`, `next_package_file`), the `.oareg` files waiting on the add-registry queue
(`post_registry_file`, `take_registry_file`), `post_opened_file`, which sends
a `.oareg` file there and every other opened file to the package queue, the
change that waits for the run playing its target to end
(`set_pending_change`, `finish_pending_change`) and its outcome, and the
discard folders the start's recovery found.

`oa/app/package_install/prompts.hpp` builds every prompt the install shows
(`oa::ui::engine_settings::Prompt`): its text through the interface
catalogue, its buttons and what each answers.

`oa/app/package_install/handoff.hpp` has the instance lock and the hand-off
folder a second start writes its files into for the copy already
running. The folder's name stays `opened-mods`.

## Kinds

`kKinds` in `src/kinds.cpp` is the table. It holds `oamod`, then `oamap`,
then `oalang`. A mod uses the extension `.oamod`, the manifest `oamod.yaml`
(at most 256 KiB), the root folder `Mods` and the prefix `.oamod-` on the
installer's own folders and on the lock. A map pack uses `.oamap`,
`oamap.yaml` (the same limit), the root folder `Maps` and the prefix
`.oamap-`. A language pack uses `.oalang`, `language.yaml` (the same limit),
the root folder `Languages` and the prefix `.oalang-`.
`package_kinds`, `kind_for_file` and `find_kind` read the table; `mod_kind`
is the mod entry. A file whose extension is none of them is refused as
`unknown_kind`, and nothing is read.

Reading the container, unpacking, the renames, recovery, the lock,
discarding, the inbox and the hand-off are the same for every kind. They
take the kind and build the seven folder names from its prefix
(`folder_names`). A kind supplies those names and the hooks: `read_manifest`
fills what the package installs and the kind's own fields, `read_installed`
and `read_backup` say what a folder holds, `plan` decides where it goes,
`check_staged` checks the unpacked files before they are put in place (null
checks nothing) and `prompts` words every prompt. The oamod hooks are
`src/plan_oamod.cpp` and `src/prompts_oamod.cpp`
(`oa/app/package_install/oamod.hpp`): the profile resolved twice, where a
mod goes, and the words a mod install shows. `Package::profile` is that
resolved profile, and null for every other kind.

### Adding a kind

A new kind is wired in five places, and nowhere in the generic files:

- `src/plan_<kind>.cpp`, implementing the hooks (`read_manifest`,
  `read_installed`, `read_backup`, `plan`, and `check_staged` when the
  staged files need a check of their own).
- Its line in `add_library` in this module's `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Its entry in `kKinds` in `src/kinds.cpp`.
- Its branch in each function of `src/app/runtime_package_kinds.cpp`.
  `package_options` is where the runtime hands the hooks their `context`,
  and `package_changed` is where the app takes in what a change put in place.
- Its test `app-package-install-<kind>`.

A kind's own refusals go at the end of `Refusal`, worded by its
`KindPrompts::refusal_text`.

### Map packs (.oamap)

The hooks are `src/plan_oamap.cpp` and `src/prompts_oamap.cpp`
(`oa/app/package_install/oamap.hpp`). The shared reading, unpacking and
renames are the ones above. Before a pack is put in place the kind checks,
and refuses with every problem named:

- `oamap.yaml` reads in package use. Every diagnostic is kept; the prompt
  shows the first three and the log has them all.
- Every file a map lists, and every preview, is in the package. Names match
  ignoring ASCII case.
- Every other file is one a map lists. A file outside `maps`, `features`,
  `anims`, `objects3d` and `previews` is refused as outside those folders,
  and one inside them that no map lists is refused as unused.
- A preview is a PNG of at most 2 MiB and at most 1024 pixels on a side.
- `requires.engine`, when the manifest writes one, is met by this build.
  The range is read with the shared engine-range rules, and the sentence
  names the range and this build's version.
- Every map fits the base game. `check_staged` calls the `FitHooks` that
  `PackageOptions::context` points to, once per map, and the runtime's hook
  builds the base store. No hooks, which only a test gives, skips the check.
  The kind does not build that store itself. A clash with a mod is not a
  reason to refuse.

A file the player opened asks "Install the map pack {name} {version}
({n} maps)?" before a new folder is made, and asks to update, reinstall or
replace as a mod does. Nothing is installed alongside. A catalogue package
whose target's origin record names the same registry replaces that folder
with no question and keeps one `.backup`. The same id from another registry
asks to replace, and the question names both registries. A folder that does
not hold this pack's `oamap.yaml` is left as it is.

A catalogue map pack also installs when the main menu is not showing, on
any screen except while a match loads or runs, and it shows no prompt. A
plan that needs a question goes back to the inbox and is asked on the
settled main menu. A refusal is reported, with its sentence, and not shown
off that menu. A file the player opened, of any kind, and a package of
another kind, still wait for the settled main menu.

### Language packs (.oalang)

The hooks are `src/plan_oalang.cpp` and `src/prompts_oalang.cpp`
(`oa/app/package_install/oalang.hpp`). The shared reading, unpacking,
renames, lock, `.backup`, recovery and origin record are the ones above.
Before a pack is put in place the kind checks, and refuses with the problem
named:

- `language.yaml` reads. `no_manifest` says it holds no `language.yaml`.
  A manifest the reader refuses keeps that reader's message.
- `requires.engine`, when the manifest writes one, is met by this build.
  The sentence names the range and this build's version.
- Each listed font is an entry `fonts/<file>` of the package. A missing
  font names that entry.
- The warm-up, when named, is in the package, at most 4,096 bytes, and
  UTF-8.
- Each of `translate.tdf`, `missions.tdf`, `pictures.tdf`, `units.tdf` and
  `interface.tdf` that is present is at most 4 MiB and parses. A failure
  names the file and the parse error. A table that is absent is skipped.
- `check_staged` opens each listed font. One that does not open is refused
  after unpacking, the staging is discarded, and the pack already installed
  is left as it was.

A file the player opened asks "Install the language {endonym} ({English
name})?" with Install and Cancel. The same version at a higher revision, or
a folder that is not this pack, asks to replace, and the old folder is kept
as `.backup`. The same version and the same revision, when that revision is
not zero, asks to reinstall. Nothing is installed alongside, and Play now
is not offered.

A catalogue language pack asks nothing and shows no prompt. It installs
while Settings or a notice show, and in a run nobody watches, and it does
not install while a match loads or runs. The same version and revision is
installed again; any other folder already there is replaced and kept as
`.backup`. What became of it is reported, and not shown.

## What a package holds

A zip archive (`oa/formats/zip/stream.hpp` says which) whose top holds
`oamod.yaml`, matched without case, or which holds one folder at its top
that holds it, as the Finder's Compress makes: that folder is stripped.
`__MACOSX` folders, `.DS_Store` files and AppleDouble files (a last part
starting `._`) are ignored, and so is a `.backup` folder of its own, which
is ours. It is refused, before anything is written, for:

- a file that cannot be read, or is not a zip archive; a damaged directory
  or entry;
- no `oamod.yaml` where it should be, one larger than 256 KiB, or one whose
  profile does not resolve (its diagnostics are kept);
- a name that cannot be unpacked on every system (`portable_name_problem`:
  each part 1 to 255 bytes of UTF-8 without control characters or `< > : "
  | ? * \`, not ending in a dot or a space, and not a name Windows keeps for
  a device), two names that differ only in the case of their ASCII
  letters, as the game matches names, or a file and a folder of one name;
- more than 16,384 folders (`max_package_folders`), those its paths pass
  through included;
- a link or a special file, an encrypted entry, or one packed otherwise
  than stored or deflated;
- more than 4 GiB unpacked, or more than 64 MiB unpacked and more than 200
  times its own size;
- an id that names a device on Windows.

The names are kept as a tree of their parts, each part once under its
folder, so reading a package takes memory that grows with the parts it
names, never with the length of its paths.

Unpacking also refuses too little room on the disk (the files and 64 MiB
more), an unpacked path longer than the system opens less 16 characters,
and a file or folder that exists already when it is made, as a name the
file system folds to another's does: every file and folder is made anew,
never over another.

## Where a package goes

The plan looks at `Mods/<id>` (A), then at the folders Install alongside
makes, `Mods/<id>-<version>` and `-2` to `-99` (B), the version made
folder-safe (`version_folder_part`). The first row that applies wins:

| A | B | Plan |
|---|---|---|
| this mod, the same version, another revision | any | UPDATE MOD on A |
| this mod, the same version and revision | any | ALREADY INSTALLED on A |
| not as above | one holds this mod at the same version, another revision | UPDATE MOD on it |
| not as above | one holds this mod at the same version and revision | ALREADY INSTALLED on it |
| missing | | installed into A with no question |
| this mod, another version | | ANOTHER VERSION: replace A, or install alongside in the first free B |
| anything else | | FOLDER IN USE: install alongside in the first free B; A is never replaced |
| either of the last two with no free B | | refused |

A revision that cannot be read counts as another.

## Changes

Every change is a sequence of renames on the volume Mods is on, each
refusing a name that exists (`rename_exclusively`) and tried again for up to
ten seconds while another program, such as a file sync or a virus scanner,
holds the files. The folders it uses lie in Mods, named after the target
`T`: `.oamod-staging-T` (S), `.oamod-old-T` (O), `.oamod-replaced-T` (X),
`.oamod-restore-T` (R) and `.oamod-discard-T-n` (D).

| Change | Renames |
|---|---|
| install | S to T |
| replace | T to O; S to T; O's own `.backup` to D; O to `T/.backup` |
| reinstall | T to X; S to T; X's `.backup` to `T/.backup`; X to D |
| roll back | `T/.backup` to R; T to O; R to T; O to `T/.backup` |

Every rename moves a folder whole, so the origin record inside it goes with
the folder. A roll back writes no record of its own.

So three installs keep one version back: after revisions 1, 2 and 3 the
folder holds 3, its `.backup` 2, and 1 is deleted. A roll back swaps the
two, so a second undoes the first. A failure before the new files are in
place undoes what was done; after it, the rest is tried once more, and what
it could not settle is renamed to a visible `<T>-left-over` folder.

Before a change, the target must still hold what the plan found, or it is
refused as changed; a roll back is refused as changed when `T/.backup` is
a link or junction. Once the files are in place, T and Mods are synced, and
on macOS the drive's cache is flushed to storage, before the player is
told. A copy of the game holds the lock on `Mods/.oamod-lock`
while it unpacks or changes Mods, so that another copy's recovery never
touches its folders; that copy's installs are refused as busy meanwhile.

Recovery runs once at every start before the mod folder is resolved, and
again after a change that waited for its run. For each target it finds
folders of: X with T missing, X goes back; X with T, X's `.backup` moves
over and X goes. O with T missing, O goes back; O with T, O's own `.backup`
goes and O becomes `T/.backup`. R with T and no `T/.backup`, R becomes it;
R with T missing, R becomes T. S goes. Every crash point of every change
settles so to the state before it or after it. What it cannot settle
becomes `<T>-left-over`. Every D it finds is deleted, whatever it is.

The `Discarder` removes at most 64 entries, or works 4 ms, a step. Links and
junctions, a D that is one included, are removed, never entered, so that a
`.backup` or staging folder someone made a link to a folder outside Mods
drops only the link; read-only files are made writable first.

A link (`is_link_or_junction`) is a symbolic link, or on Windows a reparse
point whose tag is a name surrogate (`reparse_tag_is_link`): a junction,
mount point or symbolic link, which names another place. A folder or file
with any other tag is itself, such as one a file sync keeps in the cloud,
as the sync of Documents does on many Windows machines: the plan reads it
as a mod, recovery settles it, the `Discarder` enters it and ROLL BACK
takes it. A reparse point whose tag cannot be read counts as a link.

## Origin records

An install writes `.oa-origin.yaml` into the staging folder after the
package's last file and before the folders are synced, so the rename that
puts the folder in place carries the record with it. The record says
whether the package came from a file or one release of a registry's
catalogue, and the SHA-256 of the package file, which the unpacking
computes. A folder with no record, such as one installed by an earlier
version or made by hand, is not an error and is never matched to a release.

```yaml
# Written by Open Annihilation when it installed this folder; not part of the package.
oa-origin: 1
origin: catalogue
registry: coreprime
catalogue-id: example-mod
release: 27
sha256: <64 lowercase hex digits>
installed: 2026-11-02
```

A file the player opened is `origin: file` and omits `registry`,
`catalogue-id` and `release`; it still holds the file's SHA-256. When the
origin brings a SHA-256 and the package file's differs, the install stops
as damaged and the target is left as it was. A package's own
`.oa-origin.yaml` at its top is left out, as its `.backup` is.

A replace keeps the old record in `.backup`. A reinstall replaces the
target's record and leaves the kept version's. A roll back swaps the two
folders, records included, and writes nothing. Recovery moves folders
whole and never edits a record. Replacing the record of a folder that
already holds a package refuses while the root folder's lock is held, and
a replace that fails leaves the previous record as it was.

## Tests

- `app-mod-install-package`: a Finder-made package, a package with its
  profile at its top and a `.backup` of its own, a packaged INI file the
  second resolution reads, the folders a package makes, each refusal of a
  package once (more folders than a mod may take as paths of 254 folders
  each), the name rule and the folder-safe version.
- `app-mod-install-plan`: each row of the table over a Mods folder kept in a
  map, and each prompt's title, buttons, first mark and sentences, each
  fitting its height with a long path.
- `app-mod-install-change`: an install, three replaces, a reinstall, two roll
  backs and an install alongside in a scratch Mods folder; a rename refused
  at each step of each change; every crash point settled; the folders
  recovery cannot settle; the retries and waits; a rename never replacing;
  links in a discard folder; a `.backup` linked to a folder outside Mods,
  dropped by a replace and refused by a roll back, and a discard folder
  that is such a link, each leaving that folder whole; the Windows reparse
  tags taken as links, as values, so that it runs everywhere; files made
  anew only; a target that changed; the lock; the room and path checks;
  the files a step makes held to its budget.
- `app-mod-install-handoff`: the instance lock and the hand-off folder,
  including a `.oareg` and a `.oalang` taken back in order.
- `app-package-install-inbox`: `post_opened_file` routes each extension in
  any case, the registry queue keeps order and drops a repeat, and a
  `.oareg` file leaves the package queue untouched.
- `app-package-install-origin`: the origin record's text and the texts it
  refuses; an install, replace, roll back, reinstall and recovery in a
  scratch Mods folder, each record moving with its folder; a package's own
  origin file left out; a catalogue hash that differs refused; the hash
  phase held to its budget; `write_origin` replacing a record and refusing
  a missing folder, a link and a lock that is held; the folder hooks'
  records; catalogue outcomes kept, capped and taken once, including one a
  pending change reports.
- `app-package-install-kinds`: the kind table holds `oamod`, `oamap` and
  `oalang`, a file is a package by those extensions, the seven folder names
  of each, and a made-up kind built in the test installs, replaces, rolls
  back, recovers and discards through the generic code, including a staged
  check that refuses.
- `app-package-install-oalang`: the pseudo pack installed into a scratch
  Languages folder, a Reinstall question for the same package, a Replace
  that keeps the old revision in `.backup`, a manifest inside one top
  folder, and each refusal, including a font that does not open after
  unpacking and an entry the shared names check refuses.

The native checks `native-mod-install` and `native-language-install`
(`docs/development/testing.md`) install packages in the game itself.

## Limitations

A package's names are checked by their ASCII letters for case, as the game's
own lookups match names (`AssetStore` in `oa/formats/hpi.hpp`); two names
that only a file system takes for one, by the case of other letters or by
another Unicode form, are refused where it does, when the second cannot be
made anew, and both unpack where it does not. Archives that span several
disks or carry data before their first entry are not read. The stock game
data has no unit texts in a pack's word, so a pack's `units.tdf` is checked
and read, and those names stay as the game data gives them.
