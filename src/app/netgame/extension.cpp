// Network play's extension, filled by oa_extension_init_netgame: the hooks
// through which oa-game runs the multiplayer screens, networked matches, .tad
// playback (a --play-demo run's, and a recording the engine hands over to
// replay one tick at a time) and the network checks. The extension owns
// network play's state for each runtime its hooks are called for
// (NetworkPlay, network_play.hpp), and RuntimeExtension turns each hook into
// work on that state. The screen host and services, which
// stay the same while the runtime lives, are kept from an overlay registered
// for them: a request to close the window and the leaves it leads to end the
// program through them. An extension built on network play reaches it
// through oa/app/netgame/extension_api.hpp, whose hooks this extension calls.
