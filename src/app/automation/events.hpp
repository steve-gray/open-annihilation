// The events the automation endpoint sends unasked to a client that
// subscribed to them: what changed in the screen shown, the battle room and
// the running match. The endpoint learns them by comparing what the game
// holds at each frame's pump stage with what it held at the last, and, while
// a match loads and no frame runs, from the loading's progress; it adds
// nothing to the simulation to learn them and changes nothing of the game.
//
// Each event carries its kind, its number among the client's events (seq),
// and the frame and tick it was seen in, then its own members:
//
//   screen     name, previous (null for the screen shown as the client
//              subscribed to screen), dialogs (those over the screen)
//   player     change ("joined" or "left"), slot, name: a battle-room seat
//   ready      slot, name, ready
//   chat       where ("room" or "match"), from, to (a chat line sent to
//              one player, else absent), text
//   loaded     player and slot (null while this machine's own load has no
//              players yet), progress (0 to 100), local
//   match      change ("started" or "ended")
//   pause      paused
//   speed      speed (1 to 20; 10 is normal)
//   alliance   from, from_slot, to, to_slot, allied
//   game_over  outcome ("victory" or "defeat"), winner (a name, or null)
//   transfer   accepted by subscribe, never sent yet: no part of the game
//              that the endpoint reads reports units or resources given
