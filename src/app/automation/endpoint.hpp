// The automation endpoint: a listener on this machine's loopback address,
// served from the main loop's frame hook on the main thread, never waiting.
//
// One client at a time. A connection whose first bytes are not "AUTO/1 "
// is closed unanswered. Its first frame must be a hello naming the run's
// token, read with limits a hello needs (hello_json_bytes, no payload): a
// connection whose first bytes make no such frame is closed unanswered, a
// wrong token, or another request, is answered denied and the connection
// closed; while a client is connected, another connection's first frame is
// answered busy and the connection closed. A connection that sends no
// frame within first_frame_timeout_ms is closed. The client's requests are
// then taken in order, each answered by the handler the request table
// (requests.hpp) names for its op; a handler may hold its request, to
// answer it on a later frame, and no other request is taken until it does.
// The events the client subscribed to go out unasked among the answers,
// numbered from 1 for each client. Answers and events wait in a buffer
// while the client does not read them; a client that lets it grow past
// max_waiting_output_bytes is dropped. A client that ends its side of the
// connection has every request it sent before answered, and leaves once
// the answers are written. Each time it is served the endpoint reads at
// most read_budget_bytes from each connection and takes requests for at
// most request_budget_us, so that a busy client never holds a frame up;
// and it reads nothing from a connection while a whole frame of its bytes
// waits to be taken, so that a client sending faster than the game answers
// is held back by the connection itself.
