//   frame = i32 LE sequence + records back to back (one sender per frame)
//
// Broadcast channels (destination 0) number frames -2, -3, ... and wrap
// from INT32_MIN back to -2; unicast frames always carry -1. Receivers keep
// the last sequence per sending peer and hold back at most one frame that
// arrives ahead of the expected one. All storage is fixed-size.
