/// followed by its ROLL BACK, then OPEN MODS FOLDER), the footer's buttons,

/// the open section's rows, Developer's list and Mods' list are each
/// searched first from within, rows they do not show included. Left and

/// slider or a drop-down, Your files' mark, a row of Developer's list, Show
/// Active Only. From any other control they move the focus to the control
/// on that side, as Up and Down do. A row's control lies across its row
/// for the arrows. An arrow that finds no control that way leaves the focus
/// where it is. From no focus, Up shows the focus on the last control in
/// the declared order; Down, Left, Right, Tab and Space on the first.
///
/// Page Up, Page Down, Home and End scroll the open section whatever has
/// the focus, and never move or show it. A key that moves the focus onto a
/// row, or acts on a focused row, first scrolls the least that shows the
/// row whole. Space opens a focused drop-down's list, and Left and Right
/// step its choice. While a list is open the keys work it: Up and Down mark
/// the item above or below, Page Up and Page Down a list's height of items
/// away, Home and End the first and the last; Enter and Space choose the
/// marked item and close the list; Escape closes it unchanged; Tab and
/// Shift+Tab close it and move the focus. In Developer Mode's list, Space
/// opens or closes an area or a hack, and Left and Right close and open an
/// area or turn a hack off and on. While a question shows, the keys answer
/// it: Y, or Enter or Space while SWITCH is marked, answers SWITCH; N,
/// Escape, or Enter or Space while CANCEL is marked, answers CANCEL; Left,
