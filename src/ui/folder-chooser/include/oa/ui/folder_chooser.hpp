// The in-engine game folder chooser's model: the list of found folders with
// Browse…, the 1997 demo, the desktop's dialog where offered and Quit; the
// folder browser with its places, the parent folder, the folders and "Play
// this folder"; their layouts in the Game files screen's look, the hit test,
// the focus order and what presses and keys ask of the app. Pure: no SDL and
// no app header.
