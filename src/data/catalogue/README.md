# data/catalogue

A registry's catalogue: the packages it offers, and the check that the bytes
are the ones a trusted key signed. The format is `catalogue` 1. The signature
is a detached file, one line, over the exact bytes. Nothing here fetches.

[catalogue.hpp](include/oa/data/catalogue/catalogue.hpp) and
[check.hpp](include/oa/data/catalogue/check.hpp) are the entry points
(`oa::data::catalogue`).

## Entry points

- `read_catalogue` reads the structure and the entries. It does not check a
  signature or a sequence. A member this build does not know is ignored. A
  member named twice in one object refuses the catalogue. One package that
  breaks a rule is left out, and the reason is kept when fewer than 100
  reasons are kept already.
- `valid_reference`, `valid_package_key` and `parse_utc_time` are the rules
  for a path, a package key and a UTC time.
- `parse_signature_file` and `signature_file_text` read and write the
  detached signature line.
- `check_catalogue` checks a fetched catalogue: its size, then for a signed
  registry the signature over the exact bytes, then the JSON, the registry
  id, the sequence and the entries. `Checked::usable` is true for `accepted`
  and `unchanged`. An expired catalogue is still usable, with `expired` set.
  An added registry whose `keys` is present and differs from the trusted set
  reports `new_keys`. A built-in registry's keys are ignored, and an empty
  key list is never a rotation.

## State

None. The caller keeps the catalogue and the previous sequence.

## Invariants

- Nothing is parsed before its signature is verified. A signed registry's
  catalogue is not read as JSON until the signature has been checked against
  the exact bytes.
- The sequence never goes back. The same sequence with the same bytes is
  unchanged. The same sequence with other bytes is refused.
- One bad entry never hides the rest. A bad signature or a bad structure
  refuses the whole catalogue.

## Tests

`data-catalogue` reads the format, including skipped entries and refused
catalogues. `data-catalogue-check` signs catalogues in the test and covers
the signature, the sequence, expiry and key rotation.

## Limitations

- No network and no cache. Fetching and storing a catalogue, and writing a
  rotation, are F08's.
- The format is version 1.
- Time is the caller's clock, compared with `expires` as seconds since 1970.
  A catalogue is expired when that clock is at or after `expires`.
- A map's title is 1 to 64 bytes, and a name under `compatible` is 1 to 256
  bytes. A map's stem is whatever text is written before the one `@`.
- A field that belongs to another kind is ignored.
- A package's `size` may be 2^32.
