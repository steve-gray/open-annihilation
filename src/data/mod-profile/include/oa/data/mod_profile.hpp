// A mod profile (oamod.yaml) resolved against the registry: how a mod
// differs from 3.1c, as the plain records the rest of the engine reads, with
// the canonical form and the two hashes that name the ruleset.
//
// Resolution follows the registry's order for each parameter, later steps
// winning: the 3.1c baseline while the entry is absent or false; the
// registry default once it is on; a named preset; the profile's own value;
// the player's settings, for install and match parameters the profile binds;
// the host's choice for one game, for match parameters; then the player's
// own overrides of standard hacks (Developer Mode), each checked as a
// profile's hack is and left out with a warning when it does not fit. (A
// per-unit or per-weapon data key, the last step, applies to that unit or
// weapon only, when its files are read.)
//
// The profile is validated as it is read. A missing author or packaging
// block, an unknown key, hack, script
// extension or data key, a value of the wrong type or out of range, an
// index mounted twice, a binding of a fixed parameter, a constraint broken,
// a data key whose hack is off, or a hack this engine does not implement yet
// each refuses the profile, naming the offending path and where it is
// written; nothing falls back to 3.1c silently. A development run may accept
// hacks that are not implemented yet, which then only warn.
//
// The canonical form is the effective profile as RFC 8785 canonical JSON;
// the full hash is its SHA-256, and the sim hash the SHA-256 of its sim-scope
// part, which every machine of a network game must share.
//
// This layer reads bytes and plain values only and never opens a file.
