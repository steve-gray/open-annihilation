// Language packs: a folder of texts for one language, which adds to the

// file:
//
//     zh-Hans/
//       language.yaml   the manifest (PackManifest)
//       translate.tdf   the game's own texts, in Translate.tdf's shape:
//                       [English text] { <word> = ...; }
//       units.tdf       [UNITNAME] { name = ...; description = ...;
//                       name-from = <English>; description-from = <English>; }
//       missions.tdf    [mission file] { missionname = ...;
//                       missiondescription = ...; missionhint = ...; }
//       interface.tdf   the engine's own words, as the interface catalogue
//                       (interface_text.hpp) reads them
//       pictures.tdf    captions drawn over the player's own pictures
//       files/          whole files in the game data's language folders,
//                       as files/camps/briefs-<word>/<briefing>.txt
//       fonts/          font files the manifest's fonts key names
//       warmup.txt      characters drawn ahead, when the manifest names it
//
// The application reads the files and hands their bytes here; nothing here
// opens a file. For a language L the game tries, in order: a mod's pack for
// L, the game data in L's word, the player's pack for L, the engine's pack
// for L, then the same for each of L's fallbacks, then English. An absent
// or empty value falls through to the next. Packs change only what players
// read: nothing here reaches the simulation, a saved game or what a shared
// game sends.
