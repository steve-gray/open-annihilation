// name in itself, the word 3.1c's game data knows it by, the languages its
// text falls back to and what drawing its text needs. The operating
// system's preferred locales and the player's choice in the settings are
// matched against them here; the text of each language comes from the game
// data through 3.1c's own keys (oa/data/defs/locale.hpp) and, for the Open
// Annihilation interface's own words, from the interface catalogue
// (oa/data/languages/interface_text.hpp). Nothing here reaches the
// simulation, a saved game or what a shared game sends.
//
// Adding a language is usually a language pack: its manifest becomes an
// entry when the pack is installed (set_pack_languages). A language 3.1c's
// data holds is an entry of src/registry.inc, so the game knows it without
// a pack. A language whose letters the game cannot draw yet waits,
// unoffered, until the drawing it needs (TextNeeds) is built.
