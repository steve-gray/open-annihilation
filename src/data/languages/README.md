# data/languages

The languages the game shows its text in, and the tables that hold its text
in them for what players see. Nothing here reaches the simulation, a saved
game or what a shared game sends. [docs/languages.md](../../../docs/languages.md)
describes the whole for players and for adding a language.

## The registry

`oa/data/languages.hpp` (namespace `oa::data::languages`) holds every
language the game can show, and every language a pack exists for that is
not installed yet.

- **Built in.** `src/registry.inc` (`kLanguages`) lists a language 3.1c's
  data holds, so the game knows it without a pack. English comes first.

| Tag | Name in itself | 3.1c's word | Draws in |
|---|---|---|---|
| `en` | English | `English` | the game's fonts |
| `de` | Deutsch | `German` | the game's fonts |
| `es` | Español | `Spanish` | the game's fonts |
| `fr` | Français | `French` | the game's fonts |
| `it` | Italiano | `Italian` | the game's fonts |
| `zh-Hans` | 简体中文 | `Chinese` | the modern fonts |

Each entry has its BCP-47 tag, its name in itself (`endonym`, UTF-8) and
in English, 3.1c's word for it (`game_name`: Translate.tdf's key, the
start of a unit file's `<Language>Name` and `<Language>Description` keys,
the end of its folders' names such as `bitmaps-German`), the system
locales that choose it, the tags its text falls back to before English,
and what drawing it needs (`TextNeeds`). English has 3.1c's word too,
which the game runs in by default; its data holds no English entries, but
a mod's may.

- **Installed.** One entry for each language pack in the player's
  `Languages` folder and in the `languages` folder beside the game, taken
  from the pack's manifest. A pack whose tag is one of the built-in
  languages adds its text to that language and does not change its name,
  its word or what drawing it needs. A mod's pack adds text only and adds
  no entry.
- **Available.** A language a pack exists for that is not installed.
  `kOfferedLanguages`, after `kLanguages`, lists the ones the engine knows
  of before any catalogue is read. Each entry is written with
  `Source::available`. The table is empty. An installed pack for one of
  those tags takes its place among the languages the game shows, and an
  available entry passed for the same tag is dropped. An available
  language can be listed and matched. It is never the language the game
  shows, the operating system never chooses it, and 3.1c's word does not
  find it.

`known_languages()` returns a pointer to each live language: English
first, then every built-in and installed language in the order of their
names' UTF-8 bytes, a tie broken by tag, then the available languages in
that same order. The built-ins are already in that order, so with no
packs installed the list is the table above and nothing moves. An entry
stays readable for the whole run, including one a later change has
replaced and left off the list. The list itself lasts until the next
change. The registry is changed and read only by the thread that draws
the interface.

- `english()`, `find_by_tag()` (any live language, any case, `_` read as
  `-`) and `find_by_game_name()` (a language the game can show, by 3.1c's
  word, any case).
- `fallback_chain()`: the language, its known fallbacks, then English, each
  once.
- `normalised_locale()` writes a system locale (`de_DE.UTF-8@euro`) as a
  tag (`de-DE`); `C` and `POSIX` are none. `match_locale()` finds the
  language one of whose locales is the tag or its leading subtags (`de`
  for `de-AT`), the longest winning, among the languages the game can
  show. Passed a second argument that is true, it finds an available
  language too. The locales of languages not offered yet (Traditional
  Chinese's `zh-Hant`, `zh-TW`, `zh-HK` and `zh-MO`) take part in that
  match and choose none, so `zh-TW` never falls to `zh` and Simplified
  Chinese. `preferred_language()` takes the first locale, in order, that
  chooses a language the game can show, else English.
- `chosen_language()` reads the setting: `system_choice` (`"system"`) or a
  tag of a language the game can show; anything else, including a language
  that is not installed, is the system's.
- `playable()`: the language is not available, and this build draws it.
- `drawable()`: the needs this build meets, `game_fonts` and
  `modern_fonts`. A language that needs more is kept but not offered.
- `set_pack_languages()` publishes the installed packs and the available
  languages. `registry_generation()` changes when the live list's entries
  do.

## Texts for what players see

- `oa/data/languages/unit_texts.hpp`: `UnitTexts`, units' names and
  descriptions in each language their files give, which the unit loaders
  fill through a `oa::data::defs::UnitTextSink`
  (`oa/data/defs/unit_texts.hpp`), and `data_words()`, the words a
  language's text is looked up by. The application installs the table, the
  words and the sink (`set_unit_texts`, `set_unit_text_sink`); every place
  that shows a unit type's name or description asks `unit_display_name()`
  or `unit_display_description()`, which fall back to the type's own
  `UnitDef.name` and `description`. The definitions themselves keep Name
  and Description in every language.
- `oa/data/languages/translation.hpp`: the hook the game's own texts are
  translated through, which the application fills from
  `gamedata\translate.tdf` in the language shown (`set_translation_hooks`).
  `translation_of()` and `installed_translation()` translate by the exact
  text; `language_folder_path()` gives a file's place in the language's
  folder, as 3.1c looks there first; `installed_word()` the word itself.
- `oa/data/languages/interface_text.hpp`: the interface catalogue,
  `InterfaceText`, the engine's own words in the languages translations are
  given for, read from TDF files whose sections name the English text and
  whose keys are tags; `set_interface_language()` and `interface_text()`.
- `oa/data/languages/language_pack.hpp`: language packs, a folder of texts
  for one language that adds to the game data's own translations entry by
  entry. `read_manifest()` reads `language.yaml` with the mod profiles'
  YAML reader; `LanguagePack` holds `translate.tdf` (by 3.1c's English
  text), `units.tdf` (by UnitName, each text with the English it
  translates in a `-from` key, skipped when the game data's English
  differs), `missions.tdf` (by mission file) and `pictures.tdf`
  (`PictureCaptions`, captions drawn over the player's pictures); a pack's
  `interface.tdf` is read by the interface catalogue. A `PackLayer` lists,
  for one game-data word, the packs tried before the game data (a mod's)
  and after it (the player's, then the engine's): `layered_translation()`,
  `layered_mission_text()`, `layered_pictures()` and, once installed with
  `set_unit_pack_layers()`, `unit_display_name()` and
  `unit_display_description()` look through them. The application reads
  the files; nothing here opens one. Missions' texts and files of the
  language folders reach the campaign through `TranslationHooks`
  (`installed_mission_text()`, `installed_language_file()`).

The installed tables are read only by the thread that draws the interface.

## Tests

`data-languages-packs` reads the pseudo-language's pack in
`tests/pseudo-pack` (the tests' own, never shipped), refuses manifests by
rule, and looks each kind of text up through the layers: a mod's pack
first, the game data, the player's pack, the engine's pack, an empty value
and a text no pack holds falling through, and a unit text written for
other English skipped.

`data-languages` checks the registry and its order, languages an installed
pack adds, languages that are not installed, an entry that stays readable
after a later change replaces it, the needs that are drawable, tags and
3.1c's words found in any case, fallback chains, locales normalised and
matched alone and in lists, the settings' choice, the catalogue read from
small built files, malformed and oversized ones included, the words a
language is looked up by, and the units' texts with their fallbacks,
installed and not. `defs` checks that a unit file's language keys reach
the sink, cut to their fields.
