// The streaming zip writer: an archive written a piece at a time through a
// hook, however large, as a package (.oamod, .oalang, .oamap) is made. It
// stores or deflates each entry as the bytes arrive, completes that entry's
// local header in place, and writes the central directory at the end. The
// same entries and options give the same bytes. Nothing it holds grows with
// an entry's size: one fixed output piece, the directory, and the open
// entry's name.
//
// It needs a positioned write. A pipe cannot carry it, because each local
// header's CRC-32 and sizes are written back once the entry's data ends.
