// Zip archives as the PKWARE application note describes them: the reader a
// director bundle (.oamovie) is opened with, in memory, and the writer that
// makes one.
//
// The reader takes one archive on one disk, without the 64-bit extension,
// whose entries are stored (method 0) or deflated (method 8). It walks the
// central directory from the end record, checks every entry's local header
// against its central record, and checks each entry's CRC-32 as it reads
// it. It refuses, by name and with the byte offset of the record at fault:
// encrypted entries, other methods, unsafe names (see name_is_safe),
// duplicate names, sizes past the limits below and records that run past
// the end. Entries that only name a directory (a name ending in '/') are
// listed and hold nothing.
//
// The streamed reader (oa/formats/zip/stream.hpp) reads an archive from a
// file a piece at a time, the 64-bit extension included. The streaming
// writer (oa/formats/zip/writer.hpp) stores or deflates an archive of any
// size through a positioned write hook.
//
// The in-memory writer stores its entries uncompressed, with a fixed time
// (1980-01-01 00:00) and fixed attributes, so the same entries always give
// the same bytes on every platform.
