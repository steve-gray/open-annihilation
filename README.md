**Open Annihilation** is an open-source game engine for playing
**Total Annihilation** on modern macOS, Windows and Linux, using the game
data from your own copy of the original game. Support for
**Total Annihilation: Kingdoms** is on the [roadmap](#roadmap).

No game data is included. You need an installed copy of Total Annihilation
with the 3.1 update, such as the GOG edition. To explore the project without
the full game, you can use the content of the free Total Annihilation demo
instead: see [Playing the demo](#playing-the-demo).

Open Annihilation is an independent project. It is not affiliated with or
endorsed by the owners of Total Annihilation, Total Annihilation: Kingdoms or
the Boneyards online service. Total Annihilation, Total Annihilation: Kingdoms
and Boneyards, including their names, game data and other content, are the

## Related projects

Open Annihilation is part of a family of projects for Total Annihilation and
Total Annihilation: Kingdoms:

- **[CorePrime](https://coreprime.net/)** is bringing Total Annihilation's
  Boneyards online service back to life. The services launch in the coming
  weeks: **[register at coreprime.net](https://coreprime.net/)** in advance.
- **[KBot](https://github.com/coreprime/kbot)** is an open-source toolkit with
  full support for both Total Annihilation and TA: Kingdoms game assets: a
  command-line tool for the games' file formats, and a browser-based studio
  with an asset explorer, map editor, unit viewer and live sandbox.

## Roadmap

- Completing the rest of Total Annihilation's single-player game.
- Support for **Total Annihilation: Kingdoms**.

## Settings

Open Annihilation's own settings open from the **OA** button at the bottom
right of the main menu, or under Resume in the in-game menu (F2), and with
**Cmd+,** on macOS (also **Settings…** in the application menu) or
**Ctrl+,** elsewhere. [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) shows each
section of the settings and explains every setting: what it does, its
default, when it takes effect and when you might change it.

## Mods

Open Annihilation plays mods as well as 3.1c: a mod describes how it differs
from 3.1c in one `oamod.yaml` file, and the engine applies the standard
hacks it names, with no code for any particular mod. See
[Mod support](docs/mods/README.md) for installing and choosing a mod, the
profile format and every standard hack.

## Network games from the command line

Network play goes through the Multiplayer screens, as in 3.1c, but asks
for no game disc: START never counts discs. Every OA player still tells the
other machines it has one, since a 3.1c host counts them, and the battle
room shows a CD icon only for a player on 3.1c. OA tells its own players
from those on 3.1c by the setup block each sends (record 0x20): OA writes
`O` and `A` at +0xAD and +0xAE, bytes 3.1c carries unchanged and never
reads. An OA build older than this one writes no mark, so its players show
a CD icon too.

To host or join a TCP/IP game without the screens, start the game with:

- `--host`: creates a game and opens its battle room.
- `--join ADDRESS`: joins the game at `ADDRESS`, an IPv4 address or a host
  name, and opens its battle room. The game waits up to 20 seconds for a
  game to answer there ("Waiting for host..."), as a game launched to join
  does, and joins the first that answers.

With either:

- `--player-name NAME`: your name in the game, which the battle room shows
  and sends to the other players.
- `--game-name NAME`: with `--host`, the game's name; with `--join`, the
  game to join when several answer at the address.
- `--game-password PASSWORD`: with `--host`, the game's password; with
  `--join`, the password sent.

Each is what you would type in the screens, and the same rules apply: a
name keeps 16 characters at most, and a password 10. Without them, the
screens' own entries are used. The intro is skipped, and your saved
address, name and password stay as they were. The game says on its
standard output when the battle room opens and who is in it:

```text
multiplayer: in the battle room of "XPlay" as EngineHost
multiplayer: battle room players: EngineHost, RealJoin
```

When the join fails, because no game answered, the password was wrong or
the game is full, the game list shows the notice it shows in the screens,
and the output says so:

```text
multiplayer: could not join 192.0.2.10: You did not have the correct password
```

You are then on the game list, to try again by hand. For example, on
macOS:

```sh
open -a "Open Annihilation" --args --host --player-name Ann --game-name "Friday Game"
```

and on another computer, on Linux:

```sh
./open-annihilation --join 192.168.1.20 --player-name Ben
```

## Demo Recorder

The demo recorder that recorded multiplayer games for 3.1c kept each game
in a `.tad` file: the map, the players and every message the recording
machine sent and received. Open Annihilation plays these recordings back
from the command line, and can record its own network games in the same
format. (The free 1997 demo of the game is something else: see
[Playing the demo](#playing-the-demo).)

### Playing a recording

Start the game with `--play-demo` and the recording's file:

- **macOS:** `open` passes the options only while the game is not already
  running, and needs the recording's full path:

  ```sh
  open -a "Open Annihilation" --args --play-demo ~/Downloads/game.tad
  ```

  The program inside the application also takes a path from Terminal's
  folder:

  ```sh
  "/Applications/Open Annihilation.app/Contents/MacOS/open-annihilation" --play-demo game.tad
  ```

- **Windows,** in a Command Prompt in the game's folder:

  ```bat
  open-annihilation.exe --play-demo "%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\game.tad"
  ```

- **Linux,** in the game's folder:

  ```sh
  ./open-annihilation --play-demo ~/Downloads/game.tad
  ```

- **From source:** `./run.sh --play-demo game.tad`.

After the opening movies (`--skip-intro` skips them), the recorded game
plays from its start, at the speeds its players set. You watch it as a
watcher of the game would: you move the camera anywhere on the map, but
give no orders and type no chat. **+** and **-** change the speed until
the recording changes it again, **Pause** holds the playback, and you
leave it from the in-game menu (**F2**). A recording that cannot play stops
the game and says why, in the terminal or in an error box. A recording
plays when:

- it is in version 5 of the recorder's format; other versions are refused;
- its map is installed;
- the game has the recorded game's units. Play a game recorded with a mod
  under that mod: the one chosen in the settings, or one named for a single
  run with `--mod-dir PATH` (`--base-game` plays 3.1c instead of the chosen
  mod). Otherwise the recording is refused, with a count of its unit types
  that match. `--demo-unit-table ignore` skips that check, for diagnosis
  only: units may then show as the wrong types, and the recording is still
  refused when the game's count of unit types needs unit numbers of a
  different size from the recording's. `--demo-unit-table strict`, the
  default, keeps the check;
- it has fewer than ten players, since the viewer needs a slot of its own,
  unless the mod's profile turns on
  [recorder.ten-player-replay](docs/mods/standard-hacks/recorder.ten-player-replay.md).

With `--headless-check --game-dir PATH --match-ticks N`, the game plays up
to N ticks of a recording without a window and prints a summary of the
replay ([testing guide](docs/development/testing.md#network-play)). To make a
video of a recording, [director scripts](docs/director.md) plan camera
shots over it and render them with the game's sound;
[capturing video](docs/capture.md) records what the window shows.

### Recording a game

3.1c records nothing. A network game is recorded when the mod's profile
turns on the game recorder
([recorder.ta-demo-recorder](docs/mods/standard-hacks/recorder.ta-demo-recorder.md)),
or when the game was started with `--net-record FILE`, which records the
next network game to `FILE`, replacing it, whatever the profile says. The
file is written when the game ends or you leave it, and the log names it.

The recorder saves each game in the `Recordings` folder of your Open
Annihilation folder, the one that holds your saved games, screenshots and
films. As in `Saves`, `Recordings` holds a folder for each mod, named after
its id (`Recordings/<mod id>`), and `Recordings/default` for games without
a mod:

- **macOS:** `~/Documents/Open Annihilation/Recordings`
- **Windows:** `Open Annihilation\Recordings` in your Documents folder
  (My Documents on Windows XP)
- **Linux:** `Open Annihilation/Recordings` in your Documents folder,
  usually `~/Documents`
- **iPhone and iPad:** in the Files app, On My iPhone (or On My iPad) ›
  Open Annihilation › Open Annihilation › Recordings

`--user-folder PATH` puts the Open Annihilation folder at `PATH` instead,
and with `--preferences-file FILE` it is the Open Annihilation folder
beside `FILE`. Recordings that earlier versions kept in a `demos` folder
beside the preferences file, and a mod's in `mods/<mod id>/demos` there,
move into `Recordings` once, as the installation guides describe
([macOS](docs/installation/macos.md#where-it-keeps-its-files),
[Windows](docs/installation/windows.md#where-it-keeps-its-files),
[Linux](docs/installation/linux.md#where-it-keeps-its-files)).

A file is named after the date, time and map, such as
`2026-10-05 1432 Coast To Coast.tad`; `.record NAME`, typed in the battle
room's chat, names it `NAME.tad` instead (a profile may set other
extensions). A name already taken gets ` (2)`, and so on. The recorder's
other chat commands work as the demo recorder's did:
[network.recorder-session-commands](docs/mods/standard-hacks/network.recorder-session-commands.md)
describes them and the hacks they belong to.

`--replay-viewer` is for joining a network game in which another player's
replayer plays a recording to those who join: the game presents the replay
version of the mod's profile in place of its network version.

## Playing the demo

The Total Annihilation demo, released free in 1997, is enough to try Open
Annihilation without the full game. It holds the first three missions of the
Arm campaign and 32 of the game's Arm and Core units. The demo has no skirmish
maps, multiplayer, Core campaign, saved games, movies or music, so those parts
of the game are not available with it. As in the demo, the menus gray out or
hide the entries it cannot open, and Skirmish and Multiplayer open a notice
that says so.

### Get the demo

Download **Total Annihilation.exe** from the Internet Archive:
[archive.org/details/TotalAnnihilation_201405](https://archive.org/details/TotalAnnihilation_201405).
The file is 21,540,864 bytes. To check that you have the same file, compare
its SHA-256 checksum with this one:

```text
5e41cf05226c274b4ac9e4398f74f6b321506bd7a4317ee1744ff7aceba34c49
```

- **macOS:** `shasum -a 256 "Total Annihilation.exe"`
- **Linux:** `sha256sum "Total Annihilation.exe"`
- **Windows:** `certutil -hashfile "Total Annihilation.exe" SHA256`

Open Annihilation checks the file's size and SHA-256 itself before it
unpacks the game data, whatever the file is named, and unpacks from no other
file.

### Set it up

1. Make a new folder, for example `TA Demo`, and put
   **Total Annihilation.exe** in it. Do this on macOS and Linux too. You never
   run the `.exe`, and it does not need Windows: Open Annihilation only reads
   the game data packed inside it.
2. Start Open Annihilation and choose that folder when it asks for the Total
   Annihilation folder. If you have already chosen another folder, start it
   with `--choose-game-dir` to choose again, or with `--game-dir <folder>` to
   use the demo for one run only.

The first time, Open Annihilation checks the file and unpacks the demo's
game data, about 20 MB, into a `demo-1997` folder in its per-user data folder:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/net.coreprime.open-annihilation`,
  beside its preferences. Earlier versions named it
  `com.coreprime.open-annihilation`; Open Annihilation renames that folder
  the next time it starts.
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/open-annihilation`, or
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/open-annihilation` when `XDG_DATA_HOME` is set
- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CorePrime\Open Annihilation`, beside its
  preferences (on Windows XP, `Local Settings\Application Data\CorePrime\Open Annihilation`
  in your user folder)

Later starts check the unpacked data and use it directly, and unpack it again
only if it is missing or damaged. The folder you chose is left as it is, and it
is the one Open Annihilation remembers. Keep **Total Annihilation.exe** in
that folder: Open Annihilation recognises the folder by it every time it
starts.

If you installed the demo on Windows with its own installer, choose the
folder that holds `TADemo.hpi` instead.

When you build from source, `./run.sh --game-dir "<folder>"` builds the
engine and plays the demo from that folder.
