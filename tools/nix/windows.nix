# A Windows build of the engine: the same source, cross-compiled.
#
# The toolchain and the C libraries come from the cross set the caller passes,
# so a build for an older Windows can be given a set built against the C
# run-time library that Windows ships, and one for a current Windows the
# default. zlib and FreeType are that set's own; only SDL3 is built here
# (tools/nix/windows-sdl.nix), for its patch and its static library.
#
# What makes the build a Windows one is cmake/OaWindows95.cmake or
# cmake/OaWindowsXp.cmake, chosen by the definitions passed in; the toolchain
# file named below is the one that turns those on for the compiler.
#
# Takes the text fonts, because the engine reads them beside the executable the
# same way it does everywhere else.
#
# @param toolchain the file in cmake/toolchains that names the target
# @param definitions the -D flags that pick the platform and the float mode
# @param pname the derivation's name, which says which Windows it is for
# @param description the same, in words
