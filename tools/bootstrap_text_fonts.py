"""Fetch FreeType and the text fonts, pinned, and build them into local/deps.

The engine draws text the game's own fonts cannot draw with FreeType, from
fonts that travel with the game (src/platform/text-font). This script
downloads FreeType 2.14.3 and the fonts from their projects' own releases,
checks every download against its SHA-256 and every licence text against
the one licenses/ holds, and builds:

  local/deps/freetype-install-2.14.3
      FreeType, a static library for this machine, without zlib, bzip2,
      PNG, HarfBuzz or Brotli and with only the modules the fonts need
      (tools/text-fonts/freetype_build_options.cmake); the folder is named
      after the release, so that a project building on the engine that
      pins another FreeType in the same local/deps keeps its own
  local/deps/text-fonts
      the fonts the build copies beside the game: DejaVu Sans Bold and
      DejaVu Sans 2.37, the endonym face cut from Noto Sans CJK SC Bold,
      and Noto Emoji

The full Simplified Chinese face travels with the language pack from
open-annihilation/languages, not with the engine. Cuts are made with the
fontTools that tools/text-fonts/requirements.txt pins, installed in a
virtual environment of its own (local/deps/fonttools-venv).

The endonym face, NotoSansCJKsc-Bold-Endonyms.otf, is Noto Sans CJK SC
Bold cut to the characters of tools/text-fonts/endonyms.txt that neither
DejaVu Sans Bold nor DejaVu Sans holds: the languages' own names and the
lines of the notice shown before a language pack is installed. It is at
most 64 KiB and its SHA-256 is pinned.

The test fixture's face, NotoSansCJKsc-Bold-Fixture.otf, is that same face
cut to the characters of the Simplified Chinese test fixture
(src/data/languages/tests/fixture-packs/zh-Hans) that neither sans face
holds. It is written under local/deps/text-fonts-tests, never beside the
game and never inside local/deps/text-fonts. Its SHA-256 is pinned.

Records for the four shipped fonts and the fixture face are entries of
local/deps/text-fonts.records.json, beside the fonts folder.

The fonts folder is shared by every version of the engine, so this script
only adds to it. It makes a font of its own list that is missing or whose
record differs, writing the file to a temporary name and renaming it into
place, and it never deletes or rewrites any other file.

--self-test checks the pins and the endonym list, and downloads nothing.
tools/bootstrap_macos_deps.py and tools/bootstrap_windows_deps.py build
the same FreeType for the release and the Windows targets.
