// The iOS and iPadOS platform's part of the game, registered as an extension of oa-game
// (platforms/ios/CMakeLists.txt). Its init runs before the command line is read and before
// SDL starts: it asks SDL for a landscape window whose home indicator stays out of the way,
// makes SDL's view controller keep that window landscape, full screen, without a status bar
// and never upside down in every orientation the device is held in (on iPad by turning the
// game's view inside a portrait screen), and installs the platform's hooks
// (oa/app/platform_hooks.hpp): the touch controls' haptics, the game folder in the app's
// Documents folder (or the copy built into the bundle), the advice shown without one and the
// label of the button that looks again, the player's folders shown in the Files app, the mod
// packages the system opens in the game brought into the app, and, once the window is open, the
// end of the system's three-finger editing gestures, which would otherwise take the fingers of a
// three-finger touch on the battlefield, and the window handed to the Game files screen's
// picker. It also installs the Game files screen's hooks (ios_game_files.mm). Nothing here may
// throw into the game.
