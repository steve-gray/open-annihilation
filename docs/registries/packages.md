# Packages

A registry serves three kinds of package. Each is a zip archive. OA installs
a mod into `Mods/<id>`, a map pack into `Maps/<id>`, and a language pack into
`Languages/<tag>`, using the id or tag inside the manifest, whatever the
file is called.

| Kind | Manifest | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| `oamod` | `oamod.yaml`, at most 256 KiB | [OAMOD standard](../mods/oamod-standard.md) |
| `oamap` | `oamap.yaml`, at most 256 KiB | [OAMAP standard](../maps/oamap-standard.md) |
| `oalang` | `language.yaml`, at most 256 KiB | [Languages](../languages.md) |

The catalogue entry for a package is [catalogue.md](catalogue.md). The file
the catalogue names is the zip.

A registry MUST NOT serve the original game's data. OA does not check a
package for it.

## Addressing

A registry SHOULD place each package at `/v1/p/<sha256>.<kind>` and each
picture at `/v1/i/<sha256>.png`, on the host that serves the catalogue.
`<sha256>` is 64 lower-case hex digits, the SHA-256 of the package file or
of the picture.

OA requires the catalogue's `file` to be a reference whose last segment is
`<sha256>.<kind>`. A relative reference with that last segment is also
accepted. A picture in the catalogue only has to be a reference ending
`.png`. OA does not check that a picture's file name is a hash. It does
check that the package file's last segment is the digest.

The reference is resolved against whichever host served the catalogue, so a
mirror that serves the same tree serves the same paths.

## What the archive may hold

OA reads the zip before it writes anything. It refuses an archive that is
not a zip, a damaged record, an encrypted entry, or an entry packed any way
other than stored or deflated. It refuses a name that is not safe on every
system, two names that differ only in case, a link or a special file, and an
id that names a reserved device.

The unpacked size MUST NOT exceed 4 GiB. OA keeps 64 MiB free on the disk
that holds the install folder, beyond the package's files. Once the unpacked
size is above 64 MiB, it MUST NOT be more than 200 times the size of the
archive. The archive MUST NOT unpack more than 16,384 folders, counting
folders its paths pass through. Each unpacked path keeps 16 characters spare
below the longest path the system opens.

A map preview inside a pack MUST be a PNG of at most 2 MiB and at most 1024
pixels on a side. A mod whose `requires.engine` this build does not meet is
refused. A map that does not fit the base game is refused. A language pack
is refused when a font it lists is missing or unreadable, its warm-up text
is missing, too large or not UTF-8, or its table does not parse.

Before a package is offered for use, OA has checked those limits, the hacks
the catalogue names, and, for a map, whether it fits.

## The origin record

When OA installs a package it writes `.oa-origin.yaml` at the top of the
installed folder. The record is at most 4096 bytes, UTF-8, with LF line
endings. The keys, in order, are `oa-origin` (`1`), `origin` (`file` or
`catalogue`), then `registry`, `catalogue-id` and `release` for a catalogue
origin, then `sha256` and `installed`.

`registry` is a registry id. `catalogue-id` is the package key and MUST NOT
contain `@`. `release` is a whole number from 1 to 2147483647. `sha256` is
64 lower-case hex digits of the package file. `installed` is a real UTC day,
`YYYY-MM-DD`. A folder with no record was installed by an earlier version or
made by hand; that is not an error.

## `oa-tool pack` and `oa-tool check`

`oa-tool pack FOLDER` writes a `.oamod`, a `.oalang` or a `.oamap`. The
folder's top holds one manifest, `oamod.yaml`, `language.yaml` or
`oamap.yaml`. The manifest is written first, then every other file in byte
order of its path, with fixed times. A file whose extension, without regard
to case, is `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `ogg`, `mp3`, `zip`, `gz`, `bz2`,
`xz`, `7z`, `oamod`, `oalang` or `oamap`, and an empty file, is stored.
Every other file is deflated. The same files give the same bytes on any
machine with the same zlib.

`--out FILE` names the package. Without it, the name comes from the manifest
and is written in the current folder. `--force` replaces an existing file.
A folder the installer would refuse is not packed. A map pack needs
`--game-dir DIR` for the game's palette, which previews use. `--game-dir`
on a mod or a language pack is a usage error.

`oa-tool check FILE` runs the same checks an install runs before it writes,
and reports whether that install would accept the file. `--json` prints one
JSON object. The keys, in order, are `check`, `ok`, `problems`, `warnings`,
`file`, `kind`, `id`, `name`, `version`, `revision`, `size`, `sha256`,
`unpacked_size`, `files`, then the kind's own facts:

- a mod: `summary`, `homepage`, `tags`, `author`, `requires`, `sim_hash`,
  `full_hash`, `hacks`, `packaging`;
- a language pack: `language` in place of those;
- a map pack: `summary`, `author`, `homepage`, `tags`, `requires`,
  `packaging`, then `maps`.

A key the package does not have is left out. `revision` is null when a
language pack has no packaging revision. A map pack needs `--game-dir`, the
game folder. Each `--mod FOLDER[=KEY]` is one more target after the base
game `ta-3.1c`. `maps` lists each map. `compatible` holds `ta-3.1c` and then
each mod, and `failures` holds the targets that do not fit.
`--accept-unimplemented-hacks` accepts a hack this build does not carry out
yet. The command exits 0 when the package would be installed, and 1 when it
would be refused or a map does not fit `ta-3.1c`.

The `hacks` object `check --json` prints is the object a catalogue entry
holds: `sim`, `view` and `ids`.
