# Attributions

Open Annihilation is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3
only (GPL-3.0-only; see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). The release packages also
contain the third-party software listed below. Each component keeps its own
licence, and the notices those licences require are reproduced here. Full
licence texts are in the [`licenses/`](licenses/) folder of this repository.
A build copies this file, `LICENSE` and the `licenses/` folder beside
`open-annihilation`, `oa-intro` and `oa-tool`, and on macOS into the game's
bundle, `open-annihilation.app/Contents/Resources`, so the links below also
resolve there.

No Total Annihilation or Total Annihilation: Kingdoms game data is included
in this repository or in the release packages.

The font files are in the `fonts` folder beside `open-annihilation`, and on
macOS in the game's bundle, `open-annihilation.app/Contents/Resources/fonts`.
The operating system's own libraries, such as the C and C++ runtimes and
the graphics, audio and windowing libraries, are not included.

## Builds from this source

The table above describes the release packages. A build made from this
repository with CMake links these components as follows:

- stb_vorbis, dr_mp3 and dr_flac, which decode the music, are kept in
  [`third_party/`](third_party/) and compiled into every build. The movies
  and the rest of the sound are decoded by the engine's own code.
- Monocypher 4.0.2, which checks a catalogue's signature, is kept in
  [`third_party/monocypher/`](third_party/monocypher/) and compiled into
  every build.
- When CMake is pointed at the SDL that `tools/bootstrap_sdl.py` installs,
  as `run.sh` and the README do, SDL 3.4.16 with the changes described
  under [SDL](#sdl) is linked statically. Otherwise the build takes
  whichever SDL 3.2 or later CMake finds, which may be a shared library and
  lacks those changes; the game then plays the Steam Deck's trackpad
  ticks as rumble.
- On macOS and Linux, zlib is the system's, except in the macOS release
  build below: the executables link the zlib CMake finds, and the build
  copies none beside the executables.
- The native Windows build that the README describes, with vcpkg's
  `zlib:x64-windows`, links that zlib as a DLL and copies it beside
  `oa-tool.exe`.
- The Windows cross-build, `tools/build_windows.sh`, builds zlib 1.3.1 and
  SDL for the target and links them statically.
- The macOS release build, `tools/release_macos.sh`, builds zlib 1.3.1 and
  SDL 3.4.16 for arm64 and x86_64 as static libraries with
  `tools/bootstrap_macos_deps.py` and links them into the application, as
  the macOS package in the table above has them.
- FreeType and the fonts come from `tools/bootstrap_text_fonts.py`, which
  builds FreeType 2.14.3 as a static library into `local/deps` and puts the
  fonts in `local/deps/text-fonts`; the build links that FreeType and copies
  the fonts beside the game. A build CMake points at another FreeType 2.10
  or later links that one instead. The macOS release build and the Windows
  cross-build build the same FreeType for their targets.
- The movies and music need no other library; the `ffmpeg` program that
  video capture and the director's renders start (docs/capture.md) is a
  separate program that no package contains.

## SDL

SDL 3.4.16, from <https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL3-3.4.16.tar.gz>
(SHA-256 `7322236cd12090c3eb40b9728be4d49c76f66ad17d04369584d4ecad5cf77c68`),
linked statically. **This is an altered version of SDL**: the packages'
SDL is that release with the patches in
[`tools/sdl-patches/`](tools/sdl-patches/) applied, which `tools/bootstrap_sdl.py` applies when it
unpacks the release, and which are offered upstream to SDL under SDL's own
licence. Each patch says what it changes; today there is one, which lets
SDL's Steam Deck driver send the controller a trackpad haptic report given
to `SDL_SendGamepadEffect`. The rest of SDL is as the release published
it. SDL 3.2.0, which the build also accepts, is built unchanged.

with one change that its [README](third_party/stb_vorbis/README.md)
describes. It is in the public domain, or, at your choice, licensed under
the MIT licence; both texts are in

the same licence, for the language's text. © 2014-2021 Adobe (http://www.adobe.com/). It is
